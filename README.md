# LeetCode-Solutions
Repository of all my leetcode solutions 

Warning: These solutions are probably (more like definetly) not the optimal solution. All of the solutions are complete however. Some of them are marked with a date of completion and how well it did in comparison to other submissions.

The names of the files are named in such a way such that copying the name (and adding spaces in between the words) will give you the problem on leetcode

Use this at your own risk for your own inspiration. :)
